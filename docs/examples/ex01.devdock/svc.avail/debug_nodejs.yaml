    # ^-- To start an actual debug shell, run:
    #     docker exec --interactive --tty ex01_debug_shell_1 bash -i
    # NB: No "exec" in command: "sleep" seems to ignore SIGTERM when it
    #     runs as pid 1, which would slow down stopping of the container.
    # NB: If you have docker-compose installed locally, you can use its
    #     exec instead of docker, to avoid having to guess the container
    #     name suffix. In case of dockerized docker-compose though, it's
    #     probably not worth creating the temporary container.
